The Encoder-Decoder directory contains all the JAVA code for encoding and decoding JSOCMSR instances.
Please read the comments to see how to run it. The paths to files need to be hard-coded.

The Result-Processing directory contains all the code used to process the results of the experiments.
Note that the code was actively changed to generate different plots and may require significant modifications according to what is required to be plotted.
It's mainly useful for calculating derived statistics from the raw JSON data and easily indexing the data.
It is worth mentioning that many statistics rely on availability of intermediate results and the times at which they have been found.

The code for running the experiments is not provided, as it is highly dependent on the environment on which the experiment is ran.
Also, the code for the solver modification is also not provided, as it was not yet fully complete at the moment of the project
